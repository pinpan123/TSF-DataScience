# TSF-Data Science Internship project
## Prediction using Unsupervised M.L.
We use Unsupervised Machine Learning to predict the optimum number of clusters for the iris data set and represent it visually, which consists of 3 types of flower namely Iris-setosa Iris-versicolour and Iris-virginica using data of their charcteristics as given in the .csv file. Numpy, Pandas, sklearn and Matplotlib libraries have been used in this project.
